In Development (Python)

Model detects ASL gestures for letters a,b,c and d (this is fingerspell! Individual letters)
- Model best performs with only hand in camera capture
- white/black (solid colour) uniform background preffered
- good lighting required
- speech output occurs every 20 cycles of the program
- press q to exit camera capture, then speak something into console clearly.
- speech converted to text
