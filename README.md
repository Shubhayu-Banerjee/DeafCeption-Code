# DeafCeption Fingerspell (DCF)

Model detects ASL gestures for letters a,b,c and d (this is fingerspell! Individual letters)
- Model best performs with only hand in camera capture
- white/black (solid colour) uniform background preffered
- good lighting required
- speech output occurs every 20 cycles of the program
- press q to exit camera capture, then speak something into console clearly.
- speech converted to text

# Run DCF

!! DCF Runner.py file does not work-standalone for some reason. Please open with an environment such as Pycharm/VSC !!
!! Simply install required libraries, and run DCF !!

!! Ensure all files are in the same folder !!

# DeafCeption Gesture (DCG)

- Next step towards sign language interpretion
- Gestures to be detected rather than fingerspell

!!Rapid Development Being Done on DeafCeption Gesture Model. Currently recognises four gestures!!
