# DCGX 2.2.1

**The First Proud Release of the APP(GUI) Version!**
**Also introduced multiple models to handle different signing needs.**
This version of the model **supports 109 different gestures**. The old list of [Gestures](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1603w3bCaFuYwvJoOqmAXtl877bUn0C_T/view?usp=sharing)
still holds with the addition of Yes and No gestures (use right hand).

Make sure the same file structure is maintained. Simply run DFC-Main-App.py.

> sign_detector.py and appdata/ are support files. Do not run or tamper.

**Alternatively, download the [.exe](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_yepU6pERZnCmw1GLvZSQscsO7U6gYls/view?usp=sharing) and run!**
